This year has been a reckoning for the interlinked injustices our world faces: climate breakdown, eye-watering inequality within and between states, racial injustice, and hollowed out state infrastructure brought to its knees by the pandemic. While the virus itself does not discriminate, our economy does, and those that are already marginalised have faced the sharp end of this crisis. So profound is its devastation that Covid-19 and the consequent deep economic crisis have triggered urgent questions around the operation of our economic system: how it is run, who benefits from it, and who does not.

As governments are forced to intervene in multiple ways to preserve livelihoods and stimulate recovery from lockdown, the prevailing mantra that the state should continue to shrink to allow market forces to drive the economy towards a more efficient future is rapidly losing credibility. <a href="#note-name-a" id="note-link-a" class="footnotes-link"></a> This is compounded by the failure of a market-led approach to tackle the climate crisis at the scale and pace necessary to secure a safe and resilient future.[6]/[7]Considering the chronic under-delivery on climate commitments both at the domestic and global level and the urgency of steering our economies towards a just transition, hard-learned lessons of the pandemic must lead to a realistic programme of action that is fit to respond to the existential threat of global climate breakdown. Governments and international financial institutions must dust off the industrial policy toolbox to build Green New Deals that rapidly decarbonise existing industries, nurture new green industries, secure a safe future for all, and create a wave of well-paid, unionised green jobs in the process.[8]

Having contributed to the majority of current and historic carbon emissions[9], including through colonial exploitation and resource extraction from other countries, there is an enhanced onus on wealthy states like the UK to rapidly decarbonise and shift our role in the international community, away from one rooted in subjugation and power imbalances and towards a reparative agenda of climate and economic justice.[10] Next year, the eyes of the world will turn to the UK, as it hosts the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26): a landmark moment with the opportunity to showcase a bold, transformative agenda.

There remains, however, an architecture of institutions and legal frameworks in place that can simultaneously fuel climate breakdown and inequality, the design and operation of which a global Green New Deal must challenge, reclaim and repurpose. The global trading system is one such example. Far from the simple rules-based-system for the exchange of goods and services as it is so often portrayed, the trade and investment regime today encroaches on policy and regulatory space in everything from public services to labour rights, and from food security to climate and environmental regulations. This power is coded in legal frameworks designed to boost and protect corporate profits that subsequently deepen global power imbalances: between wealthy and poorer countries, and between multinational corporations and the workers in their supply chains and on the frontline of climate breakdown.

Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, we cannot allow the aftermath to be a deregulated race-to-the-bottom of social, labour, climate and environmental standards, the consequences of which would be devastating for climate change and working class people. The world has changed a great deal since 2016 when the EU Referendum took place. Fresh calls for reform at the WTO are no longer inconceivable, even to its biggest cheerleaders, and new agendas for the future of trade are emerging. Amid the growing crisis of democracy and the rise of the far right, it is our collective duty to ensure that the trade and investment regime of the future is both aligned with and helps to deliver climate justice, economic rights, and sustainable development.

This will not be achieved by defending conventional wisdoms on trade or through hostile relationships with other regions of the world to try to discipline them to suit our interests, but with international solidarity. The climate crisis will require unprecedented resource mobilisation, cooperation and levels of trust if we are to tackle this existential threat. As the multilateral system descends further into crisis, engulfed in governance gridlock, xenophobia-driven trade tensions, entrenched inequality and looming climate collapse, now is not the time to retreat. Instead, out of the wreckage we must build a better vision of international trade that helps to deliver a climate-just world where everyone can thrive and future generations are guaranteed a stable and healthy environment.
